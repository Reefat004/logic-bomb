- **Competition-Ready**: Designed specifically for a high-stakes programming competition, ensuring functionality and reliability.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting for processing input and managing data.
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the landing page.
- **CSS**: Styling for a polished and visually appealing design.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive design framework for creating a mobile-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side scripting for interactive elements and form validation.
- **jQuery**: Simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: High-performance animations for a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **particles.js**: Library for creating animated particle backgrounds.


## üéØ Segment Description

### Logic Bomb

> _Not a single breath of air do we have the luxury of wasting. This is code red! After relentless years of chaotic blurs of gunfire, we were able to finally recover one of the terrorists‚Äô laptops containing all forthcoming plans of indiscriminate mass murder. However, there is a catch! This laptop‚Äôs data is blocked with multiple layers of security that takes only the greatest cryptologists to crack. With countless lives weighing on our fingertips, we can only rely on such masterminds to clear the safeguarding and access the laptop‚Äôs information._

> _This is your opportunity to showcase your divine wit skills on a polished pedestal. Decode clues and crypts to work out puzzle-based questions and expose the schemes behind the laptop screen. As the clock hustles, so must you!_

> _So tell me decipherer, do you have what it takes to withstand the threat made by these madmen? The fate of the entire world now rests on your hands!_
